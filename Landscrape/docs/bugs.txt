Current Bug List for LandScrape:

1. Test suite runs in a non-trivial amount of time.
  i. This is due to the fact that queries must be run in order to test scraper output, which is not a short process

2. Application is by no means "fast"
  i. Due to the fact that our scraper is curling a search on each of the websites that we are checking, so internet connection is a limiting factor of sorts

3. Our app supposes that ,in general, good input practices will be followed
  i. If you enter a list of spaces into the search bar, the best restaurants in the area will be returned
  ii. Similarly, if a single query is entered followed by a comma, the search will assume that the query is followed by a list of spaces.
  iii. While every search should return a dictionary, the results may be less helpful than expected. Entering nonsensical queries
      (numbers, gibberish, smashing keyboard against head) results in an empty output, while searching for specific people results in an
      output error. Our app is designed to work with queries for restaurants, not specific people or things
  iv. It is important to keep in mind that we are a "web-scraping" application, so sometime our results are limited by the results on the web

  4. Non-ASCII Characters are ignored by the scraper so some things end up misspelled on the client-side

  5. Sometimes the same place has a different phone number on each scraping site, so it doesn't make the link.
